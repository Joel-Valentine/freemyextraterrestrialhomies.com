This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Aims
To test the capabilities of using AI tools for web development as of December 2022. The current available tools in use for this project are:

- Dalle mini for all images
- https://chat.openai.com/chat/ for all text, coding, idea generation, styling
- Github co-pilot for additional autocomplete

The quality and feel of this website will come down to the quality of the AI tools used. The goal is to create a website that is as good as a human could produce, but with the speed and efficiency of a machine. My initial thoughts are that this will be a very difficult task, but I am excited to see what can be achieved.

Even the majority of this readme was written by Github copilot. I have only edited the text to make it more readable. code was edited to work in cases where context was lost during openai's chat.

There is a lot to be said about the potential automation of web development. I am excited to see what can be achieved. And discover what the limitations are.
